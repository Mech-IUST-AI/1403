# Face Detection Project

This folder contains the implementation of a face detection project developed by **Mohammad Talebi**, **Amirsaleh Rezaee**, and **Maryam Hoshiaripour**.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to implement a face detection system, including an advanced drowsiness detection feature. The project utilizes various machine learning and computer vision techniques for detecting faces in real-time video feeds and alerting the user if drowsiness is detected.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into the following components:

- **test**: This directory contains scripts and resources for testing the face detection functionality on sample data.
- **Driver_Drowsiness_Detection_pro**: This directory includes the core implementation for detecting driver drowsiness by analyzing facial expressions and movements.
